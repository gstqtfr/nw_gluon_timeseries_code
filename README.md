# nw_gluon_timeseries_code

This repo uses the gluon time series & applies it to a small synthetic dataset based on financial transactions.

A number of deep neural networks are applied to the data, from feed-forward MLP to RNN.

There are some of the usual Python packages, the following are necessary:

gluon_ts
mxnet
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn

The jupyter notebook shows how to preprocess the data, select the features, create a dataset, & build & apply the models to the data.
